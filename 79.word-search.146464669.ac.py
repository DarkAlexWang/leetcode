# 
# Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.
# 
# 
# The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where
# "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same
# letter cell may not be used more than once.
# 
# 
# 
# For example,
# Given board = 
# 
# [
# ⁠ ['A','B','C','E'],
# ⁠ ['S','F','C','S'],
# ⁠ ['A','D','E','E']
# ]
# 
# 
# word = "ABCCED", -> returns true,
# word = "SEE", -> returns true,
# word = "ABCB", -> returns false.
