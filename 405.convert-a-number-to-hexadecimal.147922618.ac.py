# 
# Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For
# negative integer, twoâ€™s complement method is used.
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
# The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is
# zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0'; otherwise, the first
# character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
# The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed
# integer.
# You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats
# the number to hex directly.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input:
# 26
# 
# Output:
# "1a"
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input:
# -1
# 
# Output:
# "ffffffff"
#
