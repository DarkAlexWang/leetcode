# Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both
# should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number
# should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be
# no "holes" between ranks.
# 
# 
# 
# +----+-------+
# | Id | Score |
# +----+-------+
# | 1  | 3.50  |
# | 2  | 3.65  |
# | 3  | 4.00  |
# | 4  | 3.85  |
# | 5  | 4.00  |
# | 6  | 3.65  |
# +----+-------+
# 
# 
# For example, given the above Scores table, your query should generate the
# following report (order by highest score):
# 
# 
# +-------+------+
# | Score | Rank |
# +-------+------+
# | 4.00  | 1    |
# | 4.00  | 1    |
# | 3.85  | 2    |
# |Â 3.65  | 3    |
# | 3.65  | 3    |
# | 3.50  | 4    |
# +-------+------+
# 
#
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT Scores.Score, COUNT(Ranking.Score) AS RANK
  FROM Scores
     , (
       SELECT DISTINCT Score
         FROM Scores
       ) Ranking
 WHERE Scores.Score <= Ranking.Score
 GROUP BY Scores.Id, Scores.Score
 ORDER BY Scores.Score DESC;
