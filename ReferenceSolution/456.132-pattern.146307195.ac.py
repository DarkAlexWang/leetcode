# 
# Given a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an, a 132 pattern is a
# subsequence ai, aj, ak such
# that i < j < k and ai < ak < aj. Design an algorithm that takes a list of n
# numbers as input and checks whether there is a 132 pattern in the list.
# 
# Note: n will be less than 15,000.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
# 
# Output: False
# 
# Explanation: There is no 132 pattern in the sequence.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: [3, 1, 4, 2]
# 
# Output: True
# 
# Explanation: There is a 132 pattern in the sequence: [1, 4, 2].
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# Input: [-1, 3, 2, 0]
# 
# Output: True
# 
# Explanation: There are three 132 patterns in the sequence: [-1, 3, 2], [-1,
# 3, 0] and [-1, 2, 0].
