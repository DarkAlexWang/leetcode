#
#  Given an array A, we may rotate it by a non-negative integer K so that the
# array becomes A[K], A[K+1], A{K+2], ... A[A.length - 1], A[0], A[1], ...,
# A[K-1].  Afterward, any entries that are less than or equal to their index
# are worth 1 point. 
# 
# For example, if we have [2, 4, 1, 3, 0], and we rotate by K = 2, it becomes
# [1, 3, 0, 2, 4].  This is worth 3 points because 1 > 0 [no points], 3 > 1 [no
# points], 0 <= 2 [one point], 2 <= 3 [one point], 4 <= 4 [one point].
# 
# Over all possible rotations, return the rotation index K that corresponds to
# the highest score we could receive.  If there are multiple answers, return
# the smallest such index K.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: [2, 3, 1, 4, 0]
# Output: 3
# Explanation:  
# Scores for each K are listed below: 
# K = 0,  A = [2,3,1,4,0],    score 1
# K = 1,  A = [3,1,4,0,2],    score 3
# K = 2,  A = [1,4,0,2,3],    score 3
# K = 3,  A = [4,0,2,3,1],    score 4
# K = 4,  A = [0,2,3,1,4],    score 3
# 
# 
# So we should choose K = 3, which has the highest score.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# Input: [1, 3, 0, 2, 4]
# Output: 0
# Explanation:  A will always have 3 points no matter how it shifts.
# So we will choose the smallest K, which is 0.
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# A will have length at most 20000.
# A[i] will be in the range [0, A.length].
