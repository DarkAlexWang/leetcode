#
# Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".
# 
# A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with
# any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its
# digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will
# stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those
# numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.
# 
# Example:Â 19 is a happy number
# 
# 
# 12 + 92 = 82
# 82 + 22 = 68
# 62 + 82 = 100
# 12 + 02 + 02 = 1
